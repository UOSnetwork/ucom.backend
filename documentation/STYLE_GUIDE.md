# Style guide


## Linter
It is required to follow eslint rules, declared in [.eslintrc.js](../.eslintrc.js). 
In order to check your code run the following command:

```
    make docker-check-by-eslint
```

## Conventions
TODO - here will be placed links to files that represent project conventions
