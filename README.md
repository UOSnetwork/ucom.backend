# UÂ°Community Backend API Service

## Main goals

* User authentication (via JWT tokens, stateless).
* Business logic validation before sending transactions to blockchain.
* Content storage. In future all content will be stored inside IPFS
* Blockchain information caching - for example, transactions and block producers explorer.

## Installation

All project components, except UOS blockchain, are inside docker. So it is required to configure blockchain data
manually.

### Blockchain-related configuration.

You have to create by yourself:
* blockchain account which is used to to register other accounts by backend application
* four test accounts in order to run all transaction related autotests.
* five block producers in order to run all transaction related autotests

After it you should send at least 1000 UOS tokens to every test account and even more for account-registrar
in order to pass autotests successfully and so be able to use all backend functions. 

Then create a file `/config/accounts-data.js` and inside it write down all required data. You can refer a sample file
`/config/account-data-sample.js`

You should preserve `accounts-data.js` object keys (`vlad`, `jane` etc.), but object values `account_name` might have
any value you provide.

Then create a file `/config/test.json` and provide blockchain mongodb-plugin related configuration. You can refer
a sample file `/config/test-sample.json`

### Docker part (linux only)

Install `docker` and `docker-compose`. Then create symlink in project root directory:
```
ln -s etc/docker/docker-compose-linux.yml ./docker-compose.yml
```

Then run:

```
   make init-project
```

After it in order to run tests use this command:

```
    make docker-run-tests
```

Note: There is sample `docker-compose-mac.yml`, it doesn't work. Docker compose files 
for Mac and Windows will be created in the future.

## For reference

### Blockchain MongoDB indexes

#### transaction_traces

```
account_and_name_and_from_and_to_ids
{
  "action_traces.act.account" : 1,
  "action_traces.act.name" : 1,
  "action_traces.act.data.from" : 1,
  "action_traces.act.data.to" : 1
}

account_and_name_idx
{
  "action_traces.act.account" : 1,
  "action_traces.act.name" : 1
}
```
